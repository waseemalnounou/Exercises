Exercise A: Find the number in a string

A lot of data is sent around the internet as text. But sometimes a function needs a number. There is a method for converting a string into a number (Int.Parse() and Int.TryParse()), but for this exercise these methods are not available to you. The goal of this exercise is to build a REST API endpoint in .Net (framework or core) that receives a string of alphanumeric characters and returns the whole number that's in that string.

Run the project:

cd Exercises

dotnet run --project ./Exercises/Exercises.csproj

Test:

dotnet test

-If i had more time i would test the api and try to call it in different input and test the returned result
